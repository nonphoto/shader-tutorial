            <h1>Shaders</h1>

            <h2>Shaders are for drawing things.</h2>
            <p>They are for drawing things a very specific kind of way.</p>
            <p>This way happens to be difficult, but fast.</p>
            <p>They can be intimidating at first, but using them on the web is easier then you might expect.</p>

            <h2>Why bother?</h2>
            <p>Most of the time, don't bother.</p>
            <p>We already have things like <a href="https://p5js.org">p5.js</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> which are often</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Better</li>
                <li>Easier</li>
            </ol>
            <aside>You might be tempted to use the speed of shaders everywhere, but using a framework usually makes it easier to get a fast running program.</aside>

            <h2>Shaders are for when you need to DIY.</h2>
            <p>You are responsible for a lot more of the rendering pipeline.</p>
            <p>This means more work, but it can have impressive results:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Full control over every pixel.</li>
                <li>Dynamic and non-geometric textures.</li>
                <li>Hardware-accelerated rasterization.</li>
                <li>Ludicrous speed (sometimes).</li>
            </ol>
            <aside>Rasterization is the process of turning 3d geometry into a 2d image.</aside>

            <h2>How do CPUs work?</h2>
            <p>CPUs are the main processing unit in most computers.</p>
            <aside>Many also have a GPU, which we will get to in a second.</aside>
            <p>They do one big task at a time, in sequence.</p>
            <p>Some CPUs have multiple threads that each do their own task.</p>
            <p>Part of the computation is also dedicated to deciding what to do next.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why are GPUs fast?</h2>
            <p>Rendering an image requires a very large number of small tasks.</p>
            <p>Instead of doing one at a time, thousands of threads process a chunk of tasks at once.</p>
            <p>These smaller threads can't communicate between each other.</p>
            <p>They can't decide which tasks to do.</p>

            <p>WebGL is a technology that allows you to run GPU programs on the web.</p>
            <p>GLSL is the language that GPU programs are typically written in.</p>
            <p>On the web we use Javascript running on the CPU to tell WebGL to run some programs that we wrote in GLSL on the GPU.</p>

            <h2>You need to set up the pipeline yourself.</h2>
            <p>The JS end of the program is usually confusing boilerplate.</p>
            <p>To get the best performance the JS and GLSL sides need to be tuned to each other.</p>
            <p>Its really boring so I did it for you.</p>
            <aside>A lot of it has to do with memory optimization, so it's also out of the scope of this tutorial.</aside>
